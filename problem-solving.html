        <h2 class="title-small">Blocked on a simple problem</h2>

            <p class="left-main-text">
                During the katas in the Built-in methods, I found myself stuck on the deeBee section.
            </p>

            <p class="left-main-text">
                I understood what needed to be done, making the string into an array using a split method, using the filter method and then joining everything back and returning that. However I just couldn't get rid of the buzz's from the sentence. My first point in my problem solving was to go over to the MDN website to look at the filter method and see how to implement it. After doing what I thought was right I checked over my code to see if there was an error and used console.log to see what the current outcome was. After not getting anywhere with that I went back to google to see what I could find and tested multiple code that I found and at times had minor success but it was the wrong thing I was doing to begin with, Trying to delete the buzz word for example. I then turned to a friend who was also stuck on the same issue, however by working together we were able to get to the end result of the final code.
            </p>

            <p class="left-main-text"> 
                Overall through the process I grew more frustrated as trying things that proved to be unsuccessful over and over was starting to get to me a little bit and while the minor successes did have some relief to it, ultimately it wasn't until getting to the actual solution was the weight coming off.
            </p>

            <p class="left-main-text">
                Based on the code that I tried and the code that I ended up with, what I learned was that sometimes it's not complicated code but it's more simple and to make sure when researching to try the more simple code first before going into the more lengthy code.
            </p>

        <h2 class="title-small">Elegantly solved a problem.</h2>

            <p class="left-main-text">
                For a problem that I solved with ease was during the kata exercise of manipulating objects.
            </p>

            <p class="left-main-text">Overall the process was going without a hitch until I had one slight issue with the later objects with the children names. I did what I thought was right but it was still returning an error. So what I ended up doing was to break down what was being asked, looked into what the error message said and looked over my code to see where I was going wrong. It didn't take me too long for it to click that I need and then I simply put the right code in getting me to the next step of doing the same thing I had just done for another children's name.</p>

            <p class="left-main-text">
                At first I got a little confused as what was being asked threw me off course a little but after sitting down, looking at the problem and trying something out it allowed me to keep level headed and work through the issue.
            </p>

            <p class="left-main-text">
                From this I would say I learned when in doubt check your code, look at the error and think things through.
            </p>

        <h2 class="title-small">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h2>

            <p class="left-main-text">
                <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
            </p> 
                <p class="left-main-text">
                    After a few sections about pseudocode I got the understanding of it but wasn't in the habit of doing it. However during the katas and especially the certain tasks that I found particularly difficult, I wrote down pseudocode in order to get a better understanding of what was being asked of me to code. So while I am more confident from when I started, it is still a habit I will need to do more and make sure I'm writing it in an effective manner.
                </p>

            <p class="left-main-text">
                <strong>Trying something</strong>
            </p> 
                <p class="left-main-text">
                    I have been growing more confident with trying to jump in after thinking about what is needed to. As there are times when this method is on the right track but just missing a few lines of code to get it fully working.  However this can also go down the rabbit hole of testing something that ultimately was wrong from the start. But overall, after reading the question and getting to a point where I understand what is being asked of me, I would at least attempt or research a method of solving the issue.
                </p>

                <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>
            </p> 
                <p class="left-main-text">
                    I'm confident with the concept of the Rubber Ducky method, however I have only used it a couple of times as of writing this. Much like the listening and looping sections we have been doing, it is a good way to articulate what the issue is or where I've been stuck and see if I come across the main issue that's holding me back.
                </p>

            <p class="left-main-text">
                <strong>Reading error messages</strong>
            </p>
                <p class="left-main-text"> 
                    I wasn't as confident at first, especially when some of the results were fairly vague and hunting down the issue took a lot of time. However, by doing tasks in the kata that were about the error messages, I have begun to get a better understanding of what to do should it and while not fully confident I have more than I did at the beginning of the week.
                </p>

            <p class="left-main-text">
                <strong>Console.logging</strong>
            </p>
                <p class="left-main-text"> 
                    I would say I'm confident in using the console.log just to see what the result of my code is and in the previous exercises, see how far off I was from the end result, plus seeing if the code I added was a hindrance rather than a help. At first I didn't use it as much but during the katas I started to use the console.log more and more just to see what effects certain code had.
                </p>

            <p class="left-main-text">
                <strong>Googling</strong>
            </p>
                <p class="left-main-text"> 
                    I am very confident with using google as it was mostly what I did in my previous job, so I know ways around trying to find specific things. In terms of finding code information, sometimes just going to the websites of MDN and W3 schools is enough to get started at least. As stated in the trying something method, it is also easy to go down the rabbit hole and ultimately not finding an answer to the issue.

            <p class="left-main-text">
                <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>
            </p>
                <p class="left-main-text">
                    Earlier on I was more of the mindset of just trying everything first before asking but now I try to set a time limit and then ask for help. I have been getting more confident in doing this as someone could have the answer or guide me to the answer of where I'm going wrong. So I have been reaching out more should I get stuck on an issue or looking through the discord to see if someone has already asked that question.
                </p>

            <p class="left-main-text">
                <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>
            </p>
                <p class="left-main-text"> 
                    Much like the peers question I have started to get more in the habit of asking for help. I haven't asked the coaches for help too much as so far asking from my peers has been the end point of my help. If I do get in a position and I haven't heard from the peers I've gotten in touch with I would definitely be confident to ask a coach for help for the issue I'm facing.

                <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>
            </p>
                <p class="left-main-text"> 
                    This method has slowly been improving just with the fact that it is a way to easily identify what my weak points are and that's where I can focus areas of study either as a part of my stretch or at points of downtime. Overall I would say I am confident with writing down how things are going and just seeing what areas I do need to improve on and I just need to find time to work on it.
