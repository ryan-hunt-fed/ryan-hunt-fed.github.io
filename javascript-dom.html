    <h1 class="title">Javascript Fundamentals</h1> 

    <div class="main-text">
        <h2 class="title-small">An analogy for Javascript, Html and CSS</h2>
        <p class ="left-main-text">Html, CSS and Javascript are the main building blocks of a website. The Html is your info, CSS is your style and Javascript is your functions and interactions. All these come together to create a functioning website. A way to think of it is like a talking birthday card. You have your Html which is the words presented on the front and inner of the card, the CSS is the design of the card such as the colours and positioning of the card, then the javascript is the song that triggers when you open up the card. All togther resulting in a functioning product</p>
        <h2 class="title-small">Control Flow & Loops</h2>
        <p class ="left-main-text">Control flow is the order of how the code you have is interpreted by your computer. What this means is that it will start from the top of your code and move its way down the programming code. If this didn't happen you would get a lot of broken elements as elements that were supposed to trigger wouldn't have the proper timing. Which is why control flow is important as it allows our code to be understood in the correct manner. Let's have a real world example of what a control flow should look like. Let's say our example is painting a picture, and went through these steps below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="list-orientation">Gather materials</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Ready the canvas</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Ready the paints</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Make an outline of what you want to paint</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Paint the picture</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Allow the paint to dry</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Remove the canvas</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Display the painted canvas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class ="left-main-text">See how it goes stage by stage till it gets to a good end result, this is controling the flow. Also if at any point going out of order in this example, it would cause a bad outcome and wouldn't make sense. showing why control flow is used.</p>
        <p class = "left-main-text">For certain parts of your code you would want it to run more than once or perhaps you have a button that will trigger a re-roll of the task it does, this is where loops come in. Using the same example as above, once you get to the “display the painted canvas” stage the loop would go right back to the top of “gather materials” and follow along the task list again. Allowing the same task to be completed again for however many times you've told it to.</p>
        <h2 class="title-small">The DOM</h2>
        <p class ="left-main-text">The DOM stands for Document object model. What this is is the representation of the elements in the webpage, structured much like a family tree, as shown below. </p>
        <br>
        <img id="dom-img" src="images/dom-tree.png" alt="Dom Image">
        <figcaption>DOM example <span><a href="https://www.tutorialstonight.com/js/js-dom-introduction.php">Source</a></span></figcaption>

        <p class ="left-main-text">As you can see it only includes Html as that is the main building block of the webpage. Starting from the top is the Document which you can think of your browser window, where this page is displayed. There is a step above the document called window but I won't be discussing it in this. Then it moves down to the main Html and then the different tags and sub tags that are in the html document. </p>
        <p class ="left-main-text">How to interact with the DOM is done through Javascript. In a Javascript file sometimes to get an element you would use code like document.getElementbyid. See the document., that is targeting the document in the hierarchy above and then will go through to the element you've written to be selected. With this you can change many things on the DOM such as text, colours and some functions.</p>

        <h2 class="title-small">Data from Arrays & Objects</h2>
        <p class ="left-main-text">Arrays and objects are ways to store data but are shown in different ways.</p>
        <p class ="left-main-text">Arrays are in a list format as shown below.</p>
        <br>
        <img class ="code-img" src="images/Arrayexample.png" alt="Arrays">
        <p class ="left-main-text">Arrays have their code put into square brackets “[]” and are put out on a line. Think of it much like a bookshelf where each item is a book and the bookends are the brackets and adding more items adds more books. In order to get access to the data you have to understand how they are selected. Normally you would assume that in order to get book1 you would need to put in the code book[1], however that is not the case as the count starts at 0 rather than 1. So in order for you to get the information for book1 you would need to have the code book[0] instead, as that is targeting the first item of the array. So just remember that with arrays you need to start counting from 0 rather than 1 otherwise it will get a little confusing. </p>
        <p class ="left-main-text">Objects on the other hand are displayed like this.</p>
        <br>
        <img class ="code-img" src="images/Objectexample.png" alt="Objects">
        <p class="left-main-text">Objects are displayed more in a container style and have various different values as shown in the example. Best way to think of it is that the inner items are keys (i.e color, size) and then what you chose to name them is the value (i.e brown, large). In order to access this you would need to have a line of code similar to this “hat.color” this will first look at the variable which is the hat and then look at the key inside which is color. Then the result should be the value you put in for it which in the example above is 'brown'. </p>
        <h2 class="title-small">Functions</h2>
        <p class ="left-main-text">Functions are much like tasks that are completed when told to in Javascript. They have many different things they can be programmed to do from simple text popping up to many triggers should something happen. Functions are helpful for web developers to add different events to their websites and to make things happen should a specific trigger happen. It is also a way to get around rewriting the same code over and over again, which for Javascript you shouldn't do as this is a much easier way to get multiple results of the same thing, should you want the same thing to happen more than once. Below is a simple example of a function.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="code-img" src="images/Functions example.png" alt="Functions">
        <p class ="left-main-text">As you can see in this example this is your standard setup of a function. You name the function and then you put whatever you want the function to do inside the curly brackets ({}), which can range from something small like the return element or lots of different code that will trigger when told to. Now while the function can be made, if you don't have a way to call it then the function won't happen. That's the reason for the code outside of the function as that is what is called a call or run. What that does is that when the website is going through it's control flow it will see the function but then see the call which will then trigger the function to begin it's task.</p>
