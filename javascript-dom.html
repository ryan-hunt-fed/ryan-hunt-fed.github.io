    <div class="main-text">
        <h2 class="title-small">An analogy for Javascript, Html and CSS</h2>
        <p class ="left-main-text">Html, CSS and Javascript are the main building blocks of a website. The Html is your info, CSS is your style and Javascript is your functions and interactions. All these come together to create a functioning website. A way to think of it is like a talking birthday card. You have your Html which is the words presented on the front and inner of the card, the CSS is the design of the card such as the colours and positioning of the card, then the javascript is the song that triggers when you open up the card. All togther resulting in a functioning product</p>
        <h2 class="title-small">Control Flow & Loops</h2>
        <p class ="left-main-text">Control flow is the order of how the code you have is interpreted by your computer. What this means is that it will start from the top of your code and move its way down the programming code. If this didn't happen you would get a lot of broken elements as elements that were supposed to trigger wouldn't have the proper timing. Which is why control flow is important as it allows our code to be understood in the correct manner. Let's have a real world example of what a control flow should look like. Let's say our example is painting a picture, and went through these steps below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="list-orientation">Gather materials</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Ready the canvas</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Ready the paints</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Make an outline of what you want to paint</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Paint the picture</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Allow the paint to dry</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Remove the canvas</li>
            <li class="list-orientation">Display the painted canvas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class ="left-main-text">See how it goes stage by stage till it gets to a good end result, this is controling the flow. Also if at any point going out of order in this example, it would cause a bad outcome and wouldn't make sense. showing why control flow is used.</p>
        <p class = "left-main-text">For certain parts of your code you would want it to run more than once or perhaps you have a button that will trigger a re-roll of the task it does, this is where loops come in. Using the same example as above, once you get to the “display the painted canvas” stage the loop would go right back to the top of “gather materials” and follow along the task list again. Allowing the same task to be completed again for however many times you've told it to.</p>
        <h2 class="title-small">The DOM</h2>
        <p class ="left-main-text">The DOM stands for Document object model. What this is is the representation of the elements in the webpage, structured much like a family tree, as shown below. </p>
