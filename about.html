         <p class="left-main-text"> Hello there, I'm Ryan Hunt</p>
         <p class="left-main-text">A few things about me. I am currently 28 and currently live in 
            Wellington. I first studied 3D animation in the hopes to get into the games industry as
            an artist or animator. Sadly I didn't have any luck getting my foot in the door.
            For the past 7 years, as of 2022, I have been working in IT mainly dealing with primary schools and I'm making a 
            change into something else. While I am looking at this as a new career, I fully intend to attempt 
            a side business of either making my own games or make and sell my own minatures, as that is what I originally 
            wanted to do.
         </p>
         <p class="left-main-text"> In my spare time, I like to play video games, get together with friends to either play 
            Magic the Gathering or Dungeons and Dragons, drawing (More digitally these days), miniature painting, 3D modeling and animation, catching up on the various media 
            I'm interested in and other things I'm sure I'm forgetting at this moment. Things I will like to get into at some stage would be learning piano, getting my guitar out again and playing that,
            video editing, photography (Specifically Astrophotography), 3D printing and archery but I'm lacking the spare time at the moment.
