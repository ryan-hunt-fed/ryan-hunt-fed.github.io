        <h3 class="title-small">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        
            <p class="left-main-text">
                For myself I would say three things I've learnt have been the type of mindset I have, finding out what my main values are, along with finding out what I see as my strengths and weaknesses, then finally I would say an idea of what my work ethic would be like in a coding environment. As for my ego, I would say going through this it has reiterated to me that I have a low ego, it is more the self conscious side of things that seem to be my block.
            </p>
        
        <h3 class="title-small"> What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        
            <p class="left-main-text">
                For values, in a learning and programming environment I would say that understanding what you see as important to you and how they are implemented to help you achieve your goals.
            </p>
            <p class="left-main-text">
                For empathy, I would say that the role it plays is understanding people are at different skill levels and being able to get it into your mind that people could be going through something you're not aware of or just struggling with certain parts. So by taking the time to be nice and understanding with someone who may not get the idea of what is being taught or for pieces of code, it gives them a better environment to open up about their issues.
            </p>
            <p class="left-main-text">
                For self-awareness, it's understanding where you are at with your skills for both tech and core parts. Being honest with yourself about where you need to improve, the habits you have in both learning and around people.
            </p>
        
        <h3 class="title-small"> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        
            <p class="left-main-text">
                What surprised me the most for core learning would have been finding out a more definite idea of what my mindset is, how I see myself and just in general the positives and negatives. Then having all that data laid out. While I did have an idea of how I viewed myself and my values, I hadn't given it too much thought as I was either focused on other parts of my life or occupied with either my job or personal work.
            </p>
        
        <h3 class="title-small"> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        
            <p class="left-main-text">
                I haven't found core to be too challenging in terms of what has been offered. I suppose the big thing has been trying to sift through what I'm thinking about saying/writing and just getting the words down or out. As there are times I'm just reading over the question and trying to think of the best way to answer it when it comes to questions about myself and my views.
            </p>
        
        <h3 class="title-small">
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h3>
        
            <p class="left-main-text">
                While the programming side of things is important, these days it's not only skills that get you a job, it's how you work and the methods you use to work with others. So by having these sessions of at least starting to get a knowledge of your mindset and possible new ideas that might alter the way you look at or do things can be a good preparation to start working on those skills. That way by the end of the course you'll have a good mix of coding knowledge but also a better mindset of working well with others, which is a great additional skill to have.
            </p>
        
        <h3 class="title-small"> 
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h3>
        
            <p class="left-main-text">I wouldn't say it's a waste of time no. As I said previously, while coding is a good part for a developer, it is also the skills you have working with other people and working as a team. As from doing this foundation I can see coding at times getting very frustrating and in a workplace understanding how to vent those issues out or taking a step back allows you to keep a professional atmosphere. Plus it has given new ways of thinking about mindset and a gola in mind of where you want to end up, that one especially I have been keeping in mind as I've progressed through foundations.</p>
