           <div class="main-text">
            <h3 class="title-small">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
             <p class="left-main-text">My ideal career path that I have in mind would be to start off being a front end developer as I would like to have a creative side to my job and see how that is in the field. If it is not ticking enough of a design 
                box for me I would try to transition into a designer rather than a developer. All the while I will be attempting to sell my own products once I get myself set up and should that take off in a major way I would like to expand or change my 
                coding or design to be making my own games or products. As for my long term goal, at the top it would be that I actually enjoy what I am doing, as I've been struggling with that over the years. While also making a decent living so I can 
                use that money and experience to see new things and give back to people who have helped me.</p>
             <h3 class="title-small">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
             <p class="left-main-text">I would believe some of my strengths when it comes to learning is getting down to the task of achieving something better for myself, time management for setting my goals and tasks, patience when encountering issues 
                and critical thinking when encountering a problem or planning out how I should do something. </p>
             <p class="left-main-text">For limitations I would say that one thing I will have to keep in mind is presenting as I don't overly feel comfortable conveying information to large groups. Other limitations for learning would be getting sinked 
                into a topic when I should move onto the next task, which doesn't happen too often so that is why I do have time management as a strength. There is also the matter of asking for help as I tend to do more time on research than asking for 
                assistance which could have solved my problem so I am working on that issue. </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
             <p class="left-main-text">I think in terms of my non technical core skills I would just be getting more comfortable with interacting with other students and getting out of my own head a bit. As a way to form better bonds with people or at 
                least at a better rate than I seem to be doing.</p>
             <h3 class="title-small">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
             <h3 class="title-small">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
             <p class="left-main-text">When starting to work with others I will make sure I interact with them in the politest manner to make sure it is known that I am good to work with so that we can develop a good working relationship as we 
                go through the course and beyond. That way it may lead to stronger bonds between other students which makes going through tech issues a much more friendly environment. I will also try to do things in a timely manner and should something 
                take longer than I intended I will communicate that clearly to avoid any frustration.</p>
             <h3 class="title-small">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
             <p class="left-main-text">If things start to build up for me I think my first point of call would be to take a couple hours break just to cool off and think things through, as I know from experience a heated head is not a 
                good place to be in to get a result. If things do not get better I would then see if I could talk to one of my friends or family just to air things out. If things needed to go further than that I would then direct my attention 
                to getting in contact with my homegroup facilitator and explaining the issue but I don't believe it will ever get to that stage.</p>
             <h3 class="title-small">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
             <p class="left-main-text">If I do need help I will first do my research to see if it is indeed a quick answer, if not I would talk to one of my friends that is doing the course with me to bounce ideas off of if previous 
                research didn't prove helpful. If that doesn't prove to be helpful I will then seek out the help in the discord, due to the range of issues I'm sure some overlap so seeing if someone has an issue and has solved it. 
                If even that fails me, I will talk to my homegroup facilitator and see if they can help me with the issue or redirect me to someone that could help.</p>
             <h3 class="title-small">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
             <p class="left-main-text">I would expect that the facilitation team would be understanding of the current position we are in,as the shortness and intensity of this course can lead to a large amount of pressure. So giving respect to 
                questions if they've already been answered and just general wellbeing kindness when talking to us students. </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
             <p class="left-main-text">In foundations, I have been keeping to my old schedule which means I'm in Martinborough from Saturday to Tuesday, which means on Tuesdays I have a 2 hour block out for traveling to my karori flat. 
                After foundations, this will change as I am in the in person part of Dev Academy so I will only be in Martinborough on the weekends instead. Only other block out I have is to make sure I get an hour break for lunch, then a 
                couple 15 minute breaks just to stretch my legs and when I'm in Martinborough two 15 minute sections to talk my family dog for a walk.</p>
