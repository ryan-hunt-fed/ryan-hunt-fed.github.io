            <h3 class="title-small">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
                <p class="left-main-text">
                  For my long term goal and career pathway, it has not changed much from my original thought process. In regards to a web development role, I need to have a front end developer role, as I need to have a visual design component to my work as I'm trying to fill that void from what I originally wanted to do. So possibly working with UI or something of that variety. As I have found, staring at code all day can get a bit overwhelming at times when I would like to branch out for a more visual aspect. As stated in my foundations learning plan, hopefully after landing a job and seeing how it is in the field, if it's not ticking enough of a creative box for me then I would see if I could switch from a developer to a designer which I'm hoping I could achieve within a company, rather than starting from scratch. As for other ideas for altering my pathway, I do want to learn more code and possibly delve into c# or c++ for games programming as that is the industry I wanted to be in, or use my code knowledge to make my own programs or web based games. All the while, when set up, I will be attempting to set up a side business using my 3D art skills to make some money and again trying to tick that creative box for me. 
                </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
                <p class="left-main-text">
                  For my strengths, looking over my previous answers I would say that they haven't altered during my time in foundations, more so layered them even more. In the programming side of it all I think my main strength of patience will greatly help with the bootcamp as I feel like there will be a lot of times where I'm trying to figure out code and by keeping that patience will keep me level headed. As for my other strengths of creativity and insight, they should help me provide different ideas for solutions to any issues I come across. For new skills, I don't think I came across any new ones, possibly more determination to get code working with what I thought would work (which is good when it's right but when it's wrong it could be a hindrance).
                </p>
                <p class="left-main-text">
                  For my weaknesses, for the ones listed in sprint 2 they haven't really come up during foundations as it has mainly been working remotely. But ones that I have found during foundations is asking for help takes me longer than I should as I try to push my way through an exercise as much as possible rather than going to the discord for instance within a certain timeframe. So that is one thing during Bootcamp I will need to be aware of and at least after going through the problem solving steps, be comfortable asking at least a peer for help with the current situation. So the main things of staying on a problem for too long and taking too long to ask for help will be a bit of a hindrance during Bootcamp but I plan to work on those aspects.
                </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
                <p class="left-main-text">
                  My biggest challenge I would say would be at the beginning working in groups and speaking with people I have yet to really get to know. I mainly see this as an issue as I'm not the most confident person and while I have given one of the hardest speeches of my life already, it still doesn't come all that easy to me to start out with and takes a little time to get comfortable with other people. Aside from that the other elements should be okay, the only other thing I have slight concerns with is the workload but I will know more about that when I go through it.
                </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                <p class="left-main-text">
                  I would say one big thing is just general confidence in dealing with others so this can range from engaging with people to having more difficult discussions with people in order to be a more dependable person in a workplace. There is also making sure I don't take criticism too harshly and get to a point where I understand where the person is coming from and that they're trying to help rather than take it too personally. Plus just getting used to a programming workplace environment in preparation for finishing the bootcamp. 
                </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
                <p class="left-main-text">
                  I would say my expectations for the bootcamp team is to mainly just be understanding when coming to them about certain issues whether they be about coding or core related issues. To be respectful with answers if they don't have spare time when we come up to ask them about certain  parts of the course or advice. As it would be good to feel easy about asking general questions and getting the answers from the bootcamp team.
                </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
                <p class="left-main-text">
                  For Bootcamp my expectations are to attend all classes provided my health is okay, so I get all the information that is presented. I will be making sure during the day I get at the minimum an understanding of what is expected and I will do as much work as possible in a healthy manner throughout the day. If I should ever run out of time or find myself not understanding a certain function or task, I will make sure to have a break from the work but also later after the learning hours spend some time on my own working through the issues or task. I will also be implementing to plan out my weeks more in order to stay on top of the workload that is given and have separate time limits for each task, should it go over I will then ask for help. If it is looking like I am running out of time to do the work I will get in contact with a facilitator for guidance on the issue. Should I ever get overwhelmed with the work I will first try to speak with family or friends just to air out my concerns and should it go further I will see if I can get in contact with a facilitator in order to express my feelings and look for advice or guidance. As for other learners and other staff on site I will be treating this as if it is a job environment so making sure while I will be friendly I also keep a professional manner when having interactions with others.

           <h1 class="title">Foundations Learning Plan</h1> 
            
       
           <div class="main-text">
            <h3 class="title-small">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
             <p class="left-main-text">
               My ideal career path that I have in mind would be to start off being a front end developer as I would like to have a creative side to my job and see how that is in the field. If it is not ticking enough of a design 
                box for me I would try to transition into a designer rather than a developer. If I'm still having mental issues about where I'm at, from there I would try and see alternative areas I could go into with my coding knowledge or very least coding learning learnest.
               All the while I will be attempting to sell my own products once I get myself set up and should that take off in a major way I would like to expand or change my 
                coding or design to be making my own games or products. 
               </p>
             <p class="left-main-text"> 
               As for my long term goal, at the top it would be that I actually enjoy what I am doing, as I've been struggling with that over the years. While also making a decent living so I can 
                use that money and experience to see new things and give back to people who have helped me.
               </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
               <p class="left-main-text">
                 I would believe some of my strengths when it comes to learning is getting down to the task of achieving something better for myself, time management for setting my goals and tasks, patience when encountering issues 
                and critical thinking when encountering a problem or planning out how I should do something. 
                </p>
               <p class="left-main-text">
                   For limitations I would say that one thing I will have to keep in mind is presenting as I don't overly feel   comfortable conveying information to large groups. Other limitations for learning would be getting sinked 
                   into a topic when I should move onto the next task, which doesn't happen too often so that is why I do have time management as a strength. There is also the matter of asking for help as I tend to do more time on research than asking for assistance which could have solved my problem so I am working on that issue. 
               </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">
               What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            </h3>
               <p class="left-main-text">
                  I think in terms of my non technical core skills I would just be getting more comfortable with interacting with other students and getting out of my own head a bit. As a way to form better bonds with people or at least at a better rate than I seem to be doing.
               </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
             <h3 class="title-small">
               An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
            </h3>
               <p class="left-main-text">
                   When starting to work with others I will make sure I interact with them in the politest manner to make sure it is known that I am good to work with so that we can develop a good working relationship as we go through the course and beyond. That way it may lead to stronger bonds between other students which makes going through tech issues a much more friendly environment. I will also try to do things in a timely manner and should something 
                   take longer than I intended I will communicate that clearly to avoid any frustration.
               </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
               <p class="left-main-text">
                  If things start to build up for me I think my first point of call would be to take a couple hours break just to cool off and think things through, as I know from experience a heated head is not a good place to be in to get a result. If things do not get better I would then see if I could talk to one of my friends or family just to air things out. If things needed to go further than that I would then direct my attention to getting in contact with my homegroup facilitator and explaining the issue but I don't believe it will ever get to that stage.
               </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
               <p class="left-main-text">
                  If I do need help I will first do my research to see if it is indeed a quick answer, if not I would talk to one of my friends that is doing the course with me to bounce ideas off of if previous 
                  research didn't prove helpful. If that doesn't prove to be helpful I will then seek out the help in the discord, due to the range of issues I'm sure some overlap so seeing if someone has an issue and has solved it. 
                  If even that fails me, I will talk to my homegroup facilitator and see if they can help me with the issue or redirect me to someone that could help.
               </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
               <p class="left-main-text">
                  I would expect that the facilitation team would be understanding of the current position we are in,as the shortness and intensity of this course can lead to a large amount of pressure. So giving respect to 
                  questions if they've already been answered and just general wellbeing kindness when talking to us students. 
               </p>
             <h3 class="title-small">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
               <p class="left-main-text">
                  In foundations, I have been keeping to my old schedule which means I'm in Martinborough from Saturday to Tuesday, which means on Tuesdays I have a 2 hour block out for traveling to my karori flat. 
                  After foundations, this will change as I am in the in person part of Dev Academy so I will only be in Martinborough on the weekends instead. Only other block out I have is to make sure I get an hour break for lunch, then a couple 15 minute breaks just to stretch my legs and when I'm in Martinborough two 15 minute sections to talk my family dog for a walk.
