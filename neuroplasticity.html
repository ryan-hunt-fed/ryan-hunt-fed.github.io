     <h2 class="title-small">Research Neuroplasticity</h2>

        <h3 class="title-small">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>

         <p class="left-main-text">Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people as it can change their way of thinking when it comes to the skills they have and the skills that they can learn.</p>

         <p class="left-main-text">What Neuroplasticity is, is a change to neural pathways either creating new or altering current pathways, based on the behavior and environment of the person. As the brain is considered to be plastic, which in those terms means it can be moulded into something different which is where learning comes in.</p>

        <p class="left-main-text">It can be broken down into these three different stages.</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="list-orientation">Chemical change - Initial stage, focuses on the short term memory and short term improvement. The chemical high you get when first starting out when you are learning something new.</li>  
            <li class="list-orientation">Structural change - Long term stage, focuses on the long term memory and long term improvement. This is where the practice comes into it as this is the main altering of pathways which takes time for the brain to make these alterations.</li> 
            <li class="list-orientation">Functional change - The larger stage, completely changes the brain pathways to form new pathways. This can be seen as relearning skills, or depending on the situation recovering from an accident and recovering skills you lost because of it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="left-main-text">These different stages bring a larger view to learning and relearning as the main takeaway from it is that with time, even with setbacks, a person is capable of learning new things and retaining that information. This is important as it would benefit people by understanding how the process works and what is happening when they are trying to learn a new skill.</p>

        <p class="left-main-text">So the main benefit from these principles is that anyone can learn, given the proper time and effort has been put in, but also gives people the benefit of knowing that this is a way of bad habits developing as well so it can also benefit people by keeping aware of the changes they're making.</p>

        <h3 class="title-small"> Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>

        <p class="left-main-text">In order to get a beneficial improvement from Neuroplasticity, I would say the important thing to keep in mind is that it takes time, while the first stage does make you feel a bit confident it unfortunately doesn't mean it will stick. However due to the brain being viewed as a more malleable organ it means that in time you can learn the skills you want to if you put the time into them. Also to make sure that if it is a skill I want to continue having is that I practice that certain skill so the neural pathway doesn't become obsolete and have to try and make it connect again or have a new altered pathway.</p>

        <h3 class="title-small"> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>

        <p class="left-main-text">Taking care of your wellbeing and getting into good habits. These can be such things as improving your diet or getting regular exercise. The other big thing is to make sure you practice what you are trying to learn as the more you're engaged with the content the more you're activating those neuron pathways Practice. Also to try and not give up after having a setback, as it is not always going to be improvement after improvement all the time as forming these pathways take time.</p>

        <h3 class="title-small">Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>

        <p class="left-main-text">I found these two sites helpful in getting a basic understanding of what Neuroplasticity is. <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886">Here</a> and <a href="https://accelerate.uofuhealth.utah.edu/resilience/neuroplasticity-how-to-use-your-brain-s-malleability-to-improve-your-well-being">here.</a></p>

        

     <h2 class="title-small"> Research Growth Mindset</h2>

         <h3 class="title-small">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>

        <p class="left-main-text">A growth mindset is the view that while you do have your skills, they will improve over time unlike the counter view of a fixed mindset. What this means is that as you grow you learn new skills or you want to learn a new skill, by having a growth mindset your in a position that you think in time and with enough practice you will be able to do the skill you wish to do, as intelligence is developed over time rather than having a set intelligence.</p>

        <p class="left-main-text">It is relevant because it allows people to get out of the mindset that you can't do this or I could never do that, as that is the first hurdle in starting something new. It then gets people thinking that they can make the change or learn something else to either benefit or change their life. At the very least it will get more people trying new things which will change the way they look at things.</p>

        <h3 class="title-small"> In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>

        <p class="left-main-text">I don't think anything has changed for me too much as while I haven't put a name to it, I would say I was already of a growth mindset. As I have seen in the past with my skills that by doing work and not doing work the outputs can vary. The only thing that frustrates me about it all is the slow improvement time and setbacks which has bothered me quite a bit in my art side of things as mentally it can be quite frustrating and disheartening at times.</p>

        <h3 class="title-small"> How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>

        <p class="left-main-text">Making sure I remember that if I don't get something, doesn't mean I'll never get it. Also making sure that I do practice so that way I'm retaining the information, even if it's just refresher videos in downtime for certain abilities that at the time I am struggling with. As this is a marathon not a sprint and eventually I will learn what it is I am learning at the time. Also to keep in mind that setbacks are part of the growth mindset and to not get as frustrated about that happening.</p>

        <h3 class="title-small"> Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>

        <p class="left-main-text">This site was a good read in understanding the difference between fixed and growth mindsets.  <a href="https://www.mindsethealth.com/matter/growth-vs-fixed-mindset"> Here.</a></p>

    <h2 class="title-small">Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>

        <h3 class="title-small">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>

        <p class="left-main-text">In terms of my learning plan I think that the main things that might alter is that if I think my career goal is slightly out of reach I won't put it to the side, as in time I might get to a point with the right environment and time to a place where I'm more confident about it all. Some things will stay the same just because that's what I want to do (i.e. needing to have a visual/design component). This also falls under the strength and limitations section as again looking at limitations, in time, I can grow to improve those skills which I currently see as flaws and slowly improve them. </p>
