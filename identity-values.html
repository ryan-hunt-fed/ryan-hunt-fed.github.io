            <h3 class="title-small">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, 
                and the consequences of your action.</h3>
             <p class="left-main-text">A situation that I have been in when I had an ethical decision that comes to mind is during my old job and the relationship between the client and my former employer and how things were going to go once I had left. 
                Staff at the client I worked at often got either myself or my co worker to help them out with issues. Whenever one of the higher ups came to the client it usually didn't go all that well half the time. As I was going through my leaving transition, 
                I honestly told the client that things would be different and should things get worse that they should look for another provider. The decision being in the better interest for the client rather than the company I worked for.  The consequences that 
                could happen at a later date is a more harsh view from my former employer due to my honest opinion for the benefit for the client and loss of work on their part but for the client they would be the one to benefit which was the main goal of my job.</p>
             <h3 class="title-small">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
             <p class="left-main-text">I would say my culture has influenced my values and identity by being exposed to different people and different forms of media to see what has stuck with me. From the people I have been surrounded by 
                it has definitely been my parents that have helped me grow certain views especially family views and to show respect and compassion to others. Due to recent events of losing my Mum back in 2020 it has drilled into me more the 
                ideals that she taught me over the years to which I hold dear as it keeps the memory of her still with me. As for other areas, the main things that I can recall that have helped shape me into who I am now are the different media 
                and stories that I have digested over the years. The reason I say that is you have characters who go through their struggles and go up against villains and yet somehow they get to the other side with their morals intact. 
                By the core values of kindness and honesty been shown in characters that soon resonated with me it became clear that some of those values would rub off onto my way of thinking and try to get through all of that internal thinking to get the end 
                result of the types of values I have today.</p>
            <h3 class="title-small">Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
                Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
                </h3>
                <p class="left-main-text">From the research I have gathered about myself from different sources, my main strengths seem to be patience, creativity, thinking, insightful, helpfulness, meaningful work, commitment and principled to name a few. 
                    How these all relate to learning and career development is a look of it is critical thinking and meaningful work, so taking the information provided and thinking about what needs to be done. Then I can move onto creativity which would give me 
                    areas to express alternate outcomes or designs to come out with a different end product. Then finally things such as patience will help me in this process to take a step back and then evaluate if things are going wrong. </p>
                <p class="left-main-text">The common weaknesses that I have found in my research have been, Sensitive to criticism, prone to burnout, reluctant to open up, opposition towards change and perfectionist to name some of the terms I have found. 
                    These weaknesses do seem to be in relation to other people's view of me which at times can be a bit intimidating at times. In terms of learning and career development it is all stuff I will have to work on as getting feedback is definitely a 
                    necessity in order to progress. Another thing I will have to be careful of is to make sure I am getting down time to avoid the burnout situation which I definitely felt in my last job, as I would like to enjoy what I do even if it is a side business I create.
                    As stated in regards to career development to improve these areas it would have to get better at realizing not everyone will get your vision and they might even have a better way to improve upon my idea.</p>
            <h3 class="title-small">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
            <p class="left-main-text">I believe my main strengths of creativity, insight and patience will help progress my learning journey. I believe this as a benefit as my creativity will help me think outside of the box, If a problem arises I can think of ways to try and come up with a solution 
                that should benefit the learning process. Insight will be effective in the learning process as it will be perceiving the material given and think of how it can be implemented while going through the different tasks. Patience will be a great strength to have during the learning process 
                as with a lot of code it is very easy for it to go wrong, so by having patience I can take a step back when an issue is happening and go through it step by step in order to fix the issue without losing my cool. </p>
            <p class="left-main-text">
                Other strengths such as meaningful work will also be an acceptable help as it will make sure that the work I intend on doing provides some sort of end goal for me to use, meaning that there should be passion behind each piece I make in the learning process.
                </p>
            <h3 class="title-small">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, 
                how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
                <p class="left-main-text">An experience I had with some resistance was at my previous job with certain clients. As some teachers when explaining to them the solution to their problem or when trying to get them to explain the problem can sometimes cause some frustration. 
                    This often led to being talked over when I was explaining certain parts of the process. How I dealt with this situation was to simply wait till the teacher finished speaking and once I had a space of free airspace I then continued on with the explanation of the fix or situation. 
                    This overall strategy most of the time was effective as it allowed the more questioning teachers to say their piece and then I could go back to explaining what needed to be done. Reflecting on these instances, one thing I could have done differently was to ask the teacher to wait until I had 
                    finished explaining the situation and then ask any questions after if they were still struggling with how the new system worked or how to not get back into the issue they had. The reason for this change would be to stop the same situation happening again and to show the teacher to keep in mind 
                    my view of the situation.</p>
